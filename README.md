# LITA DOCUMENTATION PROJECT 1
### PROJECT PREAMBLE
Here I document my Lita Class Capstone Project for Sales Data Performance
### DATA SOURCES
The main source of data used is Salesdata.csv and this is an open source data that can be easily downloaded as instructed by the Sponsor; the Incubator Hub.
### TOOLS USED
These are:
- Microsoft excel for data cleaning and summarisation
- -SQL Structured Query Language  for querying Data
- -Power BI for creating Table views, Expression and Visualisation with Slicer.
### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
The following process highlighted below were performed:
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Removing Duplicates from the data
3. Data Cleaning and Formating
### DATA ANALYSIS EXPLORATION
The sales data were explored to answer some fundamental questions such as:
- What is the total sales by product, region and month using pivot table.
- Using excel formula to get average sales per product and total revenue by region
- Retrieve total sales
- Find the total revenue per product
- What is the Sales Overview
- The top performing Product
- The Regional Breakdowns
### DATA ANALYSIS
This shows some basic lines of code and queries and spme of the Dax expression used during the Analysis;
