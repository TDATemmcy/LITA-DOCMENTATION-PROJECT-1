### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION
The following process highlighted below were performed:
1. Data Loading and Inspection
2. Removing Duplicates from the data
3. Data Cleaning and Formating
### DATA ANALYSIS EXPLORATION
The sales data were explored to answer some fundamental questions such as:
- What is the total sales by product, region and month using pivot table.
- Using excel formula to get average sales per product and total revenue by region
- Retrieve total sales
- Find the total revenue per product
- What is the Sales Overview
- The top performing Product
- The Regional Breakdowns
### DATA ANALYSIS
This shows some basic lines of code and queries and spme of the Dax expression used during the Analysis;
